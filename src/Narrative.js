            Hey there I’m Coach Shane. Head Coach here at KaiserFit. 
          <br /><br />
    
    
    I’ve been helping women and men transform for the last 14 years of my life. 
    <br /><br />
    In that time, I’ve helped over 30,000 women and men transform into the BEST version of themselves effortlessly on autopilot. 
    <br /><br />
    I’ve also worked as a celebrity trainer, athlete trainer and model trainer, helping celebrities get in the best shape of their lives.

    What I’m MOST proud of though… Is being just like you. 
    <br /><br />
    Everything you’ve been through, I’ve been through too. 
    <br /><br />
    I’m not like the picture perfect personal trainers, Instagram, YouTube, and TikTok influencers who look amazing all year round without trying. 
    <br /><br />
    YET these people TELL YOU what to do even though they’ve never walked a day in your shoes. 
    <br /><br />
    I HAVE! 
    <br /><br />
    I was an overweight personal trainer for most of my career.

    People would mock me all the time when I worked at my local gym. 
    <br /><br />
    I heard all sorts of things said behind my back like: 
    <br /><br />
    “That guy’s a personal trainer? Seriously? He needs to HIRE a personal trainer”  
    <br /><br />
    And one day as I was signing up a new customer to the gym, he said to me
    <br /><br />
    “Oh, you're a personal trainer? I had no idea. You don’t look like a trainer”
    <br /><br />
    These words really hurt me… But deep down, I knew they were true. 
    <br /><br />
    But the only issue was every diet, meal plan or supplement you can think of, I tried it all. 
    <br /><br />
    I had no idea how I was going to get this weight off me…
    <br /><br />
    So I went back to the gym and jumped on the nearest treadmill. 
    <br /><br />
    My plan was to run until my body was on the verge of collapsing… 
    <br /><br />
    Until, this man approached me and said…

    “Hi… My name is Mark. 
    <br /><br />
    I hope you don’t find this rude but I overheard your co-workers mention you had a heart attack? 
    <br /><br />
    I’m a professor who specialises in obesity and I really think I can help you.” 
    <br /><br />
    I took a deep breath of frustration because I thought he was going to give me the same talk that I’d heard a million times… But, I was wrong. 
    <br /><br />
    “I’ve been a member at this gym for years and have seen you gain a lot of weight even though you work out very hard. I REALLY believe you’re suffering from a condition known as Metabolic Imbalance which is destroying your metabolism and fat loss hormones”
    
    <br />
    <img src={require('./vsl-components/images/genetic.webp')} alt="genetic codes" className="img-fluid rounded" />
    <br />
    After asking me a few questions he diagnosed me with having a Suppressed Metabolism, the worst type you can have. 
    <br /><br />
    And then he got out a piece of paper and started writing on it furiously.
    <br /><br />
    After that he put this piece of paper in a brown paper bag and handed it to me with a huge smile on his face and said:
    <br /><br />
    “Just follow the simple instructions here. It will only take 30 seconds a day”
    <br /><br />
    And then in no time at all… I was in the best shape of my life! 
    <br /><br />
    Not long after that, countless women and men from my gym were begging me to help them lose weight after they saw my transformation. 
    <br /><br />
    My transformations even started to go viral online.

    And before I knew it. I had celebrities and athletes knocking on my door asking me to work with them.

    And after years of helping these millionaires and feeling unfulfilled…
    <br /><br />
    I realized that normal everyday women were suffering from Suppressed Metabolisms FAR more frequently than men due to their hormones and genetic code. 
    <br /><br />
    And this is exactly why it’s my LIFE'S MISSION to help women BREAK FREE from this Imposter and become their TRUE SELF.

      <p className="list-content">
        Right now, you’re suffering from a condition known as ‘Metabolic Imbalance’ just like I was.
        <br /><br />
    Which is SHUTTING DOWN your metabolism so that every time you eat, 
    <br /><br />
    instead of using that food as fuel and energy, your body keeps it in storage until it eventually spills over and covers your organs, taking years off your life. 
    <br /><br />
    And the very reason this happens to women is because a ‘Foreign Entity’ is attacking your body every single day without you EVER realising
    
    <br />
    <img src={require('./vsl-components/images/invasion.webp')} alt="foreign microbe entering body" className="img-fluid rounded" />
    <br />
    You see… As the human population has grown dramatically over the last 100 years, our food demand has SKYROCKETED. 
    <br /><br />
    And the ONLY solution governments and businesses came up with was using SPECIAL chemicals in our food to make it grow faster, last longer, 
    <br /><br />
    and to make it taste better all for EXTREMELY cheap prices.
    <br /><br />
    This was done to avoid food shortages, and so the human population could have access to affordable food. 
    
    <br />
    <img src={require('./vsl-components/images/farmer-chem.webp')} alt="farmer spraying chemicals on crops" className="img-fluid rounded" />
    <br />
    But now all of our food supplies are genetically modified or chemically enhanced. 
    
    <br /><br />
    Even our fruits and vegetables have been genetically modified with these chemicals to survive harsh conditions and to last longer so they don’t rot before they reach grocery stores.
    
    <br /><br />
    
    I mean just take a look at these photos, our fruits and vegetables have drastically changed when you compare them to what our ancestors ate.

    But what the government didn’t anticipate in all this was just how negatively our bodies would respond to these chemicals. 
    <br /><br />
    These chemicals and preservatives that overflow in our daily food are making our body attack itself. 
    <br /><br />
    As a result, conditions like obesity, diabetes, blood pressure, leaky gut, digestive issues, asthma, allergies, hayfever and countless others have become COMMON.
    <br /><br />
    After the introduction of these chemicals, our bodies started reacting VERY negatively because it has NO IDEA how to digest them. 
    <br /><br />
    Our food is FILLED with Chemicals like Disodium Phosphate, Propylene Glycol, and Benzoyl Peroxide, which can all be found in hair, makeup and other beauty products.

    </div>
    
    <p className="list-content">
    But why is nobody trying to stop this?
    <br /><br />
    Well it’s because these companies make TRILLIONS of dollars worldwide by doing this. 
    <br /><br />
    They have a lot of power and influence to create FAKE DATA and studies that show these ingredients are safe, so the government has a TOUGH TIME banning them. 
    <br /><br />
    And the government does NOT want a food shortage, so they have EVEN LESS reason to ban these chemicals. 
    <br /><br />
    And because our body can’t digest them, it sends signals to our brain called SOS Waves asking for help. 
    <br /><br />
    Now our brain is overloaded with requests of help from our body so it stops being able to promote optimal fat loss hormones like PEPTIDE YY and Leptin.
    
    <br />
    <img src={require('./vsl-components/images/narratives/brain-woman.webp')} alt="human brain and woman" className="img-fluid rounded" />
    <br />
    These hormones keep our fat burning in check and make sure our body is at a healthy weight, helping us get rid of excess fat easily. 
    <br /><br />
    However, because our body is no longer able to produce these hormones it gets flooded with FAT GAINING hormones such as Ghrelin and Cortisol,
    <br /><br />
    which gives us false hunger signals, slows down our metabolism and piles on those stubborn pounds that just don’t come off.
    <br /><br />
    This condition is KNOWN as Metabolic Imbalance.
    <br /><br />
    And it’s what CREATES this Imposter, and exactly why you‘re STUCK as your FAKE SELF.

      <p className="list-content">
        This is exactly why we need to activate your body's Transformation Sweet Spot.
        <br /><br />
    Because once it's turned ON, your body’s Peptide YY and Leptin hormones increase and unlock your body's TRUE potential.
    <br /><br />
    The first step is to BLOCK the ‘Foreign Attack’ reaction our brain has due to all these chemicals and send POSITIVE signals to our brain. 
    <br /><br />
    And once we do, all your transformation hormones that are shut off right now will turn on like a switch of a button. 
    <br /><br />
    Hormones that supercharge the transformation process like Peptide YY and Leptin will be flourishing inside your body making weight loss so easy.
    
    <br />
    <img src={require('./vsl-components/images/woman-measuring-waist.webp')} alt="woman measuring waist" className="img-fluid rounded" />
    <br />
    
    And bad hormones like Ghrelin and Cortisol that made you GAIN WEIGHT in the past will be shut down. 
    <br /><br />
    You see, in the world right now there are women from certain locations who actually find it IMPOSSIBLE to gain weight, so their body stays in perfect shape no matter their age. 
    <br /><br />
    Locations such as Okinawa Japan. Ikaria in Greece. And Sardinia in Italy. And many locations in France. 
    <br /><br />
    The thing I found most shocking was that women who live in these locations EAT MORE carbohydrates and calories than women living in countries like ours. 
    <br /><br />
    Women in Japan eat a LOT of rice, women in Italy LOVE pizza and pasta, women in Greece fill their food with Olive Oil.
    <br /><br />
    French women consume COUNTLESS amounts of bread and butter. Yet these women struggle to gain even an inch! 
    
    <br />
    <img src={require('./vsl-components/images/women-with-food.webp')} alt="different women with food" className="img-fluid rounded" />
    <br />
    
    What makes this even more interesting is that these fast food companies and chemically enhanced foods have made it to ALL of these regions.
    <br /><br />
    Yet these women are NOT impacted at all, in fact they are living longer and staying trimmer. 
    <br /><br />
    Why is that? 
    <br /><br />
    Well… It turns out these women’s ancestors LIVED with very special nutrients in their diet that DETOXIFIES these chemicals before they can send signals to the brain,
    <br /><br />
    which made it impossible for them to gain weight while eating all of their favourite food and doing little to no exercise. 
    <br /><br />
    Their Transformation Sweet Spot was being activated and TURNING their metabolism into an Optimal Metabolism.

    <br />
    Our body is VERY COMFORTABLE as our overweight self because most of us have been overweight for a long time. 
    <br /><br />
    So when we try to lose weight, our body thinks something’s wrong and panics so it tries to get us to STOP losing weight and start gaining it back. 
    <br /><br />
    This is why we can lose 5-10 pounds and then weight loss suddenly STOPS.
    <br /><br />
    Our body HATES change so it’s going to fight you every step of the way if you don’t know what you’re doing.
    <br /><br />
    But Professor Mark showed me EXACTLY what to do when my body was fighting me and didn’t want to lose weight.
