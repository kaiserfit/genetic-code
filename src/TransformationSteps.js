                    After struggling to lose weight her entire life with methods like the no-carb and keto diets, slimming pills, slimming coffee and slimming teas, Faith started developing serious health issues like PCOS, hypertension, dyslipidemia, asthma and hyperuricemia which only made weight loss harder. One day when Faith was looking for yet another weight loss method to try out online, she came across Coach Shane and decided to hire him as her personal coach. And after Coach Shane helped transform her body, Faith learned that all the yo-yo dieting only did her more harm than good. That's when she decided that she wanted to help people lose weight and avoid the same mistakes she made.

                    Linda is a mother of 3, owner of a successful business and a coach here at KaiserFit. For a long time Linda struggled with her weight due to many life commitments leaving her strapped for time. All the diets, exercises and meal plans she tried involved long hours at the gym and hours of meal prep which she couldn't do. Going into the gym one last time to cancel her membership, she noticed a poster of Coach Shane and his amazing transformations and decided to hire him. That’s when Coach Shane not only helped her get the body of her dreams, but made Linda realize that losing weight doesn't have to take up so much time. Linda then decided to join the team so she could teach people in her position how simple losing weight actually is.

After having 2 beautiful children, Kayla couldn't get rid of the stubborn pregnancy weight that robbed her of her confidence. All she could do is lose and gain the same 10 pounds no matter what diet she tried. But when her husband had a chance meeting with Coach Shane and told him about Kayla, that’s when she learned all those years of food restrictions and treadmill running actually made it impossible for her to lose weight. With Coach Shane’s help, she lost all the pregnancy weight easily and effortlessly, after that Kayla knew she had to help all the mothers out there struggling with their pregnancy weight, and to do that she joined the KaiserFit team!
